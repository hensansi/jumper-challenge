# Unaddressed Requirements

- Error handling implementation needs to be more robust and comprehensive

# Pending Improvements (Time Constraint Considerations)

## Architecture & Performance

- Restructure data model to separate unit values and decimals as distinct properties in frontend communication
- Implement shared type definitions between backend API and frontend services
- Optimize contract metadata handling by implementing database storage and caching mechanism
- Establish proper type definitions for Session and backend interfaces

## Code Quality & Infrastructure

- Refactor codebase to resolve inconsistencies between AppKit React examples and Next.js implementation
- Modernize Express route architecture to follow current best practices
- Address security vulnerabilities in package dependencies
- Implement version pinning for all package dependencies
- Set up Docker Compose with proper database integration

## Testing & Validation

- Complete mobile device testing suite
- Implement comprehensive error case testing, including backend failure scenarios
